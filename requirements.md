# University Board Consensus System
A multi-agent system for simulating and experimenting with consensus-finding in academic governance

## System Overview
The system simulates a university board of directors making collective decisions through AI agents, each representing different stakeholder perspectives:

### Agent Roles (Multiple Perspectives)
- Academic Affairs Agent (Faculty & Academic Programs)
- Financial Officer Agent (Budget & Resources)
- Student Affairs Agent (Student Experience & Services)
- Research & Innovation Agent (Research Programs & Grants)
- Community Impact Agent (Public Relations & Community Engagement)
- Infrastructure Agent (Facilities & Campus Development)
- Legal Compliance Agent (Regulations & Risk Management)

### Key Features
1. Multi-Agent Discussion System
   - Structured dialogue between agents
   - Role-based perspective maintenance
   - Conflict resolution protocols
   
2. Decision Making Framework
   - Proposal evaluation
   - Impact assessment across domains
   - Consensus measurement
   - Voting mechanisms

3. Documentation & Transparency
   - Decision rationale tracking
   - Dissenting opinions recording
   - Meeting minutes generation

## Technical Requirements
1. Core Dependencies
   - Python 3.8+
   - LangChain for agent orchestration
   - OpenAI API for agent intelligence
   - Vector database for institutional memory

2. Key Components to Develop
   - Agent Role Definitions
   - Consensus Protocol Engine
   - Decision Documentation System
   - Proposal Analysis Framework
   - Impact Assessment Module

3. Data Structures
   - Proposal Template
   - Impact Assessment Matrix
   - Consensus Measurement Metrics
   - Meeting Minutes Format

## Implementation Phases
1. Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure
   - Agent role definition
   - Basic communication protocols
   - Simple voting mechanism

2. Phase 2: Enhanced Decision Making
   - Sophisticated consensus algorithms
   - Impact assessment integration
   - Historical decision tracking

3. Phase 3: Advanced Features
   - Learning from past decisions
   - Stakeholder feedback integration
   - Performance metrics analysis

## Usage Guidelines
- For educational and experimental purposes
- Not intended for actual university governance
- Focus on consensus-finding methodology research

## Development Notes
- Design modular agent architecture
- Implement role-specific prompts
- Develop consensus measurement metrics
- Create documentation templates
